# ApexHelper for Apex Legends
This Repo does not hold all the files to ApexHelper. These are just some files that I wish to share for now. 

# Things the app does
- Searches and displays player's game stats.
- Displays game information such as map rotation queue (from an API).
- Displays game news feed from a Firstore server of mine.
- Displays weapon stats from the same Firestore server. (this may be changing to my own public API in the near future).
- Makes use of Google AdMob ads.
- Subscriptions handled through Revenue Cat.
- Has the ability to display notifications.

The app also has many other features within it.
This app was originally developed using Swift UIKit. However, I eventually decided to make the move to SwiftUI. So I remade the entire app from scratch and made it all in SwiftUI. Yes, I have made the app twice now. I am still working on the app to this day and continue to add to it. My current goal is to fix up some of the UI and to add animations and smooth out certain processes.
